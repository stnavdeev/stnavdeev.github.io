<p align="justify">  
My name is Stanislav Avdeev. I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Amsterdam. I am an empirical microeconomist studying human capital, with a focus on education and health. In my research, I examine discrimination and diversity in higher education and healthcare, investigating how institutional settings contribute to unequal treatment of women and migrants and how exposure to diversity affects native populations.
</p>
<p align="justify">
In addition to my academic research, I also contribute to policy work. I support evidence-based decision-making in healthcare in the Netherlands through my role at the Amsterdam Health and Technology Institute. I also contribute to education policy as an expert reviewer for UNESCO Global Education Monitoring Report.
</p>
<p align="justify">
In my work, I combine large-scale administrative and survey data from the Netherlands and Norway with quasi-experimental methods. My research has been supported by research grants from national and international organizations, including the European Association for International Education, and has been recognized with best paper awards at international conferences, such as those organized by the European Society for Population Economics and CESifo/ifo research network. My work is published or forthcoming in, among others, American Economic Journal: Applied Economics and Journal of Public Economics.
